# GitlabBackupUtil

A Small utility to backup all of your gitlab repositories to local filesystem.
You never know when international laws change and you loose access to your repos.

## Harduino's Fork Info
This repo contains fixes and improvements. I needed to make backups for all projects listed in https://gitlab.com/dashboard/projects, and original repo didn't do that for some repos, i.e. did partial backup.

Changes:
- refactor algorithm to form projects-to-backup. Original version formed personal projects (/api/v4/user.id/projects) & groups (/api/v4/groups, /api/v4/groups/group_id/projects). In this version that requests replaced with paginated retrieving all projects with your membership (/api/v4/projects/?membership=true).
- add pagination for retrieving projects list as Gitlab's max per_page value is set to 100
- fix & improve calculating of result folder. It was incorrect when you use custom Gitlab URL.
- fix Gitlab asked for creds even if you gave it token
- remove --verbose flag and enable verbosity (without sensitive information) by default

[!] Please note, that in this fork Gitlab's credentials (username+token) will be stored in repo's remote url for every backed up repo, e.g.
```shell
git remote -v
origin https://username:token@gitlab.com/group/project.git (fetch)
origin https://username:token@gitlab.com/group/project.git (push)
```

## How to Backup

### Backup using http (default)

```javascript
npm install -g gitlab-backup-util-harduino
gitlab-backup-util-harduino -t 'your-gl-token-here'
```

### Backup using ssh
```javascript
gitlab-backup-util-harduino -t 'your-gl-token-here' -m ssh
```

#### Future Scope
* - [âœ”] If the repository already exists, `git pull` instead of cloning
* - [ ] Gui for entering token


### Thats It :rocket:, Now go backup
